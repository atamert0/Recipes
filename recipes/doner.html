    <h1>Authentic Turkish Doner Kebab 🇹🇷</h1>
    <img src="../images/doner.jpg" alt="turkish-doner" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A very popular take-out especially after a night out at the pub. This
      favorite is so, so tasty--I'm sure once you try it, you'll certainly want
      to make more! Serve with warmed (lightly toasted) pita bread, chili sauce,
      and a salad of shredded cabbage, carrot, onion, and sliced cucumber. Also
      great to add as a topping for pizzas. Great to make in advance, slice and
      freeze.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon all-purpose flour.</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano.</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt.</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder.</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon onion powder.</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried Italian herb seasoning.</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper.</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper.</li>
      <li>1 ¼ pounds ground lamb.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Combine flour, oregano, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian
        seasoning, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Add ground
        lamb and thoroughly knead with the flour mixture until thoroughly mixed
        together, about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape the seasoned ground lamb and place into a loaf pan; set on top of
        a baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven, turning the loaf halfway to ensure even
        browning, about 1 hour and 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wrap loaf in aluminum foil and let rest, about 10 minutes. Slice as
        thinly as possible to make the doner kebab pieces.
      </li>
    </ol>
